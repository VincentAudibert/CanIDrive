# CanIDrive

## About
... is an Android app letting you evaluate whether you can drive or not.

It is a personnal project aimed at getting experience building something simple yet as professionnal as possible.

## Features
Can I Drive allows you to track your recent alcohol consumption, to assess if you can drive or not.

What is shown to you :
- a clear status (OK, OK but not sober, NO GO)
- your estimated blood rate
- time when you can drive again
- time when you get sober again (0.0 g/L)

Computation takes into account :
- weight
- sex
- rough health indication
- driver legal status (country, young driver, professional)
- drinks (how much alcohol and when)

If the chosen country is not available, you can select OTHER to override the threshold value with your own.
